.SH "NAME"
git-mergetool \- Run merge conflict resolution tools to resolve merge conflicts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit mergetool\fR [\-\-tool=<tool>] [\-y|\-\-no\-prompt|\-\-prompt] [<file>\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Use git mergetool to run one of several merge utilities to resolve merge conflicts\&. It is typically run after \fIgit merge\fR\&.
.sp
If one or more <file> parameters are given, the merge tool program will be run to resolve differences on each file\&. If no <file> names are specified, \fIgit mergetool\fR will run the merge tool program on every file with merge conflicts\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-t <tool>, \-\-tool=<tool>
.RS 4
Use the merge resolution program specified by <tool>\&. Valid merge tools are: kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, diffuse, tortoisemerge, opendiff, p4merge and araxis\&.
.sp
If a merge resolution program is not specified,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will use the configuration variable
merge\&.tool\&. If the configuration variable
merge\&.tool
is not set,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will pick a suitable default\&.
.sp
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the configuration variable
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.path\&. For example, you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
mergetool\&.kdiff3\&.path\&. Otherwise,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
assumes the tool is available in PATH\&.
.sp
Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.cmd\&.
.sp
When
\fIgit mergetool\fR
is invoked with this tool (either through the
\-t
or
\-\-tool
option or the
merge\&.tool
configuration variable) the configured command line will be invoked with
$BASE
set to the name of a temporary file containing the common base for the merge, if available;
$LOCAL
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file on the current branch;
$REMOTE
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file to be merged, and
$MERGED
set to the name of the file to which the merge tool should write the result of the merge resolution\&.
.sp
If the custom merge tool correctly indicates the success of a merge resolution with its exit code, then the configuration variable
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.trustExitCode
can be set to
true\&. Otherwise,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will prompt the user to indicate the success of the resolution after the custom tool has exited\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y, \-\-no\-prompt
.RS 4
Don\(cqt prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prompt
.RS 4
Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program\&. This is the default behaviour; the option is provided to override any configuration settings\&.
.RE
.SH "TEMPORARY FILES"
.sp
git mergetool creates *\&.orig backup files while resolving merges\&. These are safe to remove once a file has been merged and its git mergetool session has completed\&.
.sp
Setting the mergetool\&.keepBackup configuration variable to false causes git mergetool to automatically remove the backup as files are successfully merged\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
